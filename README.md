# Sticky Notes

This is NashFP's playground for recreating Beebole's excellent 2008 tutorial on developing web applications on Erlang. 

Excerpt from http://beebole.com/blog/erlang/tutorial-web-application-erlang/

>The purpose of all this, aside from arousing your curiosity, is to provide you with a getting started pack and allow you to go a step further in the Erlang web application sphere.
>
>I invite you to download the example application (as illustrated in the video stickyNotes.zip) in order for you to understand all the pieces of the puzzle and to venture behind the scene.
>
>Just keep in mind that stickyNotes is a one shot application that Iâ€™ve developed from scratch with the unique aim of illustrating the video example.

## Playground
For this playground, build a server backend using your functional language of choice that will support the Sticky Notes HTML/javascript front-end. 
Contribute your solution by adding a folder named {your twitter handle}/{your language}/{your web library} such as:
`/bryan_hunter/elixir/phoenix`

You can push your changes, but it's more fun to submit your solution via pull-request. Time to play!
